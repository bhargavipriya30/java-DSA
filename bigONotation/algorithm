-Before we talk about big O, it's important that we first understand what exactly an "algorithm" is

An algorithm can be seen as a recipe for a computer to follow. It's a set of instructions that a computer
will follow step-by-step to solve a problem.

Algorithms take an input and produce an output.
For example, let's say you had a non-empty array of positive integers called nums,
 and you wanted to answer the question: "What is the largest number in nums?".
 Ans: you would write an algorithm that takes an array called nums as input, and outputs the largest number in nums. Here is an example of such an algorithm:

      - Create a variable maxNum and initialize it to 0.
      - Iterate over each element num in nums.
      - If num is greater than maxNum, update maxNum = num.
      - Output maxNum.

Note: Algorithms should be deterministic. Given the same input, the algorithm should always produce the same output.
      Basically, there shouldn't be any randomness.
